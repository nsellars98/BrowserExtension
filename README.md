# BrowserExtension

A browser extension for tracking sales leads for the new Microsoft Edge web browser. This extenion can also be used with Google Chrome.

This project is part of ***The Frontend Developer Career Path*** tutorial by **Scrimba** on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/lets-build-a-chrome-extension-co85441e3b6bd2c9eeee218bf).

Planned Additions:

- Write the JSDoc for functions.
- Write the functionality to save a lead when the enter key is pressed.
- Figure out why the save tab doesn't always work (open in new tab).
- Add the styling to show a different color on the anchor tags when a linked is clicked.
- Extend the usability of the extension to Chrome.

Upcoming Updates:

- None at this time.
