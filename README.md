# BrowserExtension

A browser extension for tracking sales leads for the new Microsoft Edge web browser. This extenion can also be used with Google Chrome.

- A useful tool for sales representatives and anyone trying to save time searching for different resources all around the web.
-	Built initially for Microsoft Edge but can also be used with Google Chrome. The extension was deployed for testing purposes only and is not officially recognized on the Edge or Chrome extension web stores.
-	Sales leads can be saved to and deleted from the extension and are stored persistently via the local storage feature on the web browser.
-	Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Microsoft Edge web browser, Visual Studio Code

The project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as a part of the ***Making Websites Interactive*** tutorial of the ***The Frontend Developer Career Path*** by **Per Harald Borgen** on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/lets-build-a-chrome-extension-co85441e3b6bd2c9eeee218bf).

Planned Additions:

- Write the JSDoc for functions.
- Write the functionality to save a lead when the enter key is pressed.
- Figure out why the save tab doesn't always work (open in new tab).
- Add the styling to show a different color on the anchor tags when a linked is clicked.
- Extend the usability of the extension to Chrome.

Upcoming Updates:

- None at this time.
